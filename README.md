# Notebook to Py
This tool will convert a Jupyter Notebook to a Python file.

The Python file will contain all the code cells and the markdown cells that you choose to keep.
You can choose to keep the `H1` and `H2` tags. You can also choose to keep the code cells that have a specific tag (`#$` by default).
